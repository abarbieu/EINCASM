- Refactored
- Physics not quite integrated
	- Changing to rotation-based flow?

**Goal 0:** Get physics working and integrated - test and ensure things work
**Goal 1**: Simple online evolution - randomly perturb NN weight
- Storing simulation variables and analyses
- Genome tracking
**--> Finish over winter break**
### **Write about everything done so far**

**Goal 2**: Simple offline evolution with NEAT
- PyTorch + NEAT
- Fitness: how many cells in the environment
- Implicit map-elites: locally constrain merging based on environment (TOO MUCH?)
	- Weather/physics metrics 
	- (In large environments) what cells are close together

**Goal 3:** Compare test cases for organisms
- Mazes
- Weather
- Coordination
# 2023-11-29: Week 9
- (Moving out)
- **Goal 0:** Get physics working and integrated - test and ensure things work
# Week 10
- Final meeting, solidify timeline
- Last week 
- **Goal 0:** Get physics working and integrated - test and ensure things work
# Finals
- No meeting (remote updates etc.)
# Winter Break
- Slow/no responses
- **Write about everything done so far**

# Winter Quarter

## Weeks 1-3
-  **Write about everything done so far**
