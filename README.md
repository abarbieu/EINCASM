# EINCASM: Emergent Intelligence in Neural Cellular Automaton Slime Molds

This repo contains the complete code for:

- EINCASM (ALIFE 2023)

EINCASM is a prototype system for studying emergent intelligence in organisms resembling slime molds. The repository contains code to evolve neural cellular automata with NEAT and assess growth and adaptation in complex environments.

# EINCASM

- **In Progress**:
    - Local Physics/Constraints
    - Interactive Sim

- **TODO**:
    - NEAT Evolution
    - Checkpointing
    - Weather/Parameter Search
    - Analysis

- **Long Goals**:
    - Convert to Torch or JAX
